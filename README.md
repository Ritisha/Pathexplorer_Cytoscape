Pathexplorer_Cytoscape
======================

PathExplorer is a Cytoscape 3.x app which can be downloaded for the Cytoscape app store <http://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/pathexplorer>. 
It enables the user to choose source and destination nodes and highlights the paths from and to them respectively. It also enables the user to exclude nodes and edges based on their attributes thus filtering the paths to desired properties. The user can change the width of the paths in order to suit his/her visual style. Finally, after obtaining the desired paths, the user can select them and save them as a network for future study.
